## About this project

**Epilogue** is an FPS roguelike game where players can discover weapon upgrades, combining and mixing them to craft powerful arsenals. These upgrades manifest as shiny objects scattered throughout each level, ranging from those in plain sight to cleverly hidden ones.

## Wave Manager

In the early stages of development, I envisioned a roguelike experience with intense enemy encounters. To bring this vision to life, I implemented a robust system that dynamically spawns enemies around the player. This system was designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration with additional systems alongside the Wave Manager.

**Example Code:**  
[WaveManager C++/Blueprint (Pastebin)](https://pastebin.com/qqNcBCMV)

I meticulously designed the code to accommodate various enemy types using an Enum. This flexible system enables the dynamic spawning of enemies at random positions surrounding the player. A crucial aspect of this implementation is its consideration for the boundaries of the navigation mesh, ensuring that spawned enemies seamlessly navigate within the designated play area.

**Blueprint Examples:**

- [WaveManager Blueprint](https://blueprintue.com/render/e1asopyk/)
- [Enemy Spawn Logic (C++ side)](https://blueprintue.com/render/vdaxqd3e/)
- [Set Data Table for Enemy Spawn Wave](https://blueprintue.com/render/3jmfxkhy/)
- ![WaveManager Example](../Assets/Game%20Projects/GP4/image.png)
- ![DataTable Grouping Example](../Assets/Game%20Projects/GP4/image_1.png)

> My designer requested that we work with DataTables, and he meticulously laid out an extensive system in an Excel sheet. Everything needed to be compatible with blueprints for the convenience of our designers. Initially, I intended to implement everything in C++, but with that mindset discarded, almost everything had to be refactored to align with the blueprint. Frankly, it was a fun and rewarding challenge to overcome.

## AI

In later development, I was assigned to assist our AI designer, who was tackling this task for the first time. Unfortunately, none of our team members had prior experience in AI development. Consequently, we decided to create a basic AI, which presented its own set of challenges. One significant hurdle was implementing a pooling system to efficiently manage the large number of enemies. Even after respawning, these enemies needed to perform actions such as moving, shooting, and standing still, adding an extra layer of complexity to the task.

**Bug Example:**  
![Enemy projectile bug](../Assets/Game%20Projects/GP4/EnemyStillAliveBug.gif)

The reason for this lies in my pooling system, where I had to devise a way to prevent the enemy from shooting even in its 'dead' state. To achieve this, I incorporated `SetActorTickEnabled()` into the EnemyBase script. By checking the `IsActive` status, I can determine whether the enemy is alive. This implementation not only addresses the specific issue but also streamlines the process of pooling enemies. I applied a similar approach in my third Future Games project, "The Legend of Tronco".

**Fixed Example:**

> While there were numerous instances where I had to debug, unfortunately, there isn't enough material to showcase as these issues were relatively small, and I wasn't able to record the debugging process.

## Pooling System

I find great satisfaction in pooling elements to achieve optimal performance, continuously exploring the expansive realm of optimization. The concept of pooling allows for a more efficient utilization of resources, contributing to an enhanced overall performance.

**Pooling System Code:**

- [PoolsEnemy.cpp (BeginPool)](https://pastebin.com/qhhWUs6Q)
- [PoolsEnemy.cpp (SpawnEnemy)](https://pastebin.com/sHkwk2Qe)

**Screenshots:**

- ![Melee Enemies Hidden](../Assets/Game%20Projects/GP4/WhichEnemyIsHidden.png)

Typically, when enemies are defeated by the player, the `DestroyActor` method is employed. However, to align with my pooling system's objective of returning enemies to the pool, I've implemented a convenient method called `Deactivate` within the EnemyBase class. This method essentially broadcasts a signal indicating that this particular enemy is no longer active, facilitating its seamless return to the pool.

- ![Deactivate Method](../Assets/Game%20Projects/GP4/DemonstrateDeactivateMethod.png)

This blueprint is associated with the parent of all enemies. The `OnDeath(Health)` event is triggered when an enemy perishes. Subsequently, it utilizes the `Deactivate` function, which is marked as a blueprint callable function. This design allows any enemy to invoke the `Deactivate` function, ensuring their return to the pool instead of being outright destroyed upon demise.

## Summary

This project has been incredibly eventful and stands as my proudest accomplishment to date. Our success can be attributed to clear communication and well-defined goals. My primary contributions involved crafting a robust pooling system, implementing a WaveManager to handle enemy spawning, and taking on the role of Quality Assurance (QA) for the AI aspects.

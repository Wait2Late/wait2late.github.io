# Honkai Star Rail

## Year 2 regrets

Ever since I saw Castorice animations, I wanted her so badly with her team. I believe this was the beginning of my regret I made. With the introduction of the Remembrance path. It brought a whole new team building which costs a lot. 

What I instead should have done is investing into The Herta team. Not only is she the strongest AoE damage dealer in the game. But her biggest weakness offsets with Anaxa on the team. She is also very beautiful and I love her design.

The Herta costed one. While Castorice team costed 5. I should have invested into her instead of Castorice. In fact this debate sparked with the downhill of powercreep. The game now makes me to only want to vertically invest in my current teams.
